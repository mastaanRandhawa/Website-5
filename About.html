                            Hello! I'm a passionate student currently enrolled at SFU (Simon Fraser University), majoring in
                            Computer Science. I have a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Bootstrap,
                            JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C, C++, and Python. The art of coding and problem-solving has always
                            fascinated me, and I love exploring the endless possibilities of creating innovative solutions
                            through programming.
                            During my studies, I have gained practical experience and developed a solid understanding of web
                            development, thanks to my proficiency in Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These skills have
                            allowed me to design and build responsive and visually appealing websites.
            
                            Overall, I'm driven by my curiosity, passion, and determination to make a meaningful impact through
                            technology. I'm excited about the future of computer science and can't wait to explore the endless
                            possibilities it holds.
